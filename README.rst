SamBA : Sample Boosting Algorithm
=================================

This package provides Python code for SamBA, a boosting-based classifier that
uses similarity to learn a combination of local experts. For in-depth
information, see B.Bauvin et al, UAI 2023.

It heavily relies on scikit-learn, for examples, see the demo directory.
